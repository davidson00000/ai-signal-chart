# EXITON Trading System rules

Before generating any code, you MUST read and comprehend all specification files in /docs/specs/*.md.

Specifications include (but are not limited to):
- EXITON AI Development Constitution
- Domain Rules (DR)
- Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)
- SaaS Decisions
- Coding Style (if present)

You must obey these documents as hard constraints.

If your planned changes violate any of these rules, or if the specifications are unclear,
you MUST stop, explain the conflict, and request clarification instead of guessing.

When working on trading logic (backtesting engine, strategies, risk management, order sizing),
you are especially responsible for:
- avoiding look-ahead bias
- respecting risk limits and kill switches
- avoiding silent failures
